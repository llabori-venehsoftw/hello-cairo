##  #14DaysofCairoCode

This repo will showcase my Cairo 1.0 learning progress for the [#14DaysofCairoCode challenge](https://twitter.com/StarkNetAfrica/status/1663480540597571585). Let's get it ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ’¯.


# Day 1

I installed `rust`, `Cairo 1.0` and was able to compile and build the sample `hello.cairo` contract. I'm now starting to learn about `rust`, `Cairo 1.0` and the whole starknet eco-system and I'm loving it so far :D.
